    <h2>An Introduction to Seasons</h2>

    <h3>The Meaning of Seasons</h3>

    <div class="essay">
    <p>Seasons evade easy definition. A dictionary will report that seasons are the four divisions of the year known as spring, summer, autumn, and winter, however as with all dictionary entries this only leads to other words that need defining. It could be said that seasons are the breath of the Earth, for the world's plants absorb vast quantities of carbon dioxide as their leaves grow in the spring, releasing the oxygen that all animal life needs to survive. Yet the manifestations of seasons are so varied and so rich that to focus on any one could fill an entire volume. Rather than look outward at those manifestations, let us instead turn back and examine language itself.</p>

    <p>The English word season comes from the Latin verb <i>serere</i> meaning ``to sow'' or ``to plant.'' Looking back even further, the Latin <i>serere</i> may come from the Proto-Indo-European root *se, also meaning ``to sow,'' which is related to the English word seed. This hypothetical language, spoken 5,000 years ago or more, is thought to be the common ancestor of hundreds of living languages, ranging from Iceland to the Bay of Bengal. Thus seasons became associated with sowing seeds, and thereby harvesting food, far back in history, and indeed prehistory.</p>

    <p>Early humans obtained food by hunting animals and gathering wild plants. They were likely nomads, following the annual migrations of herds. This hugely successful strategy remained essentially unchanged for tens of thousands of years. But beginning around 12,000 years ago, some groups of people started planting seeds, and so seasons came to be associated with farming. Understanding seasons had always been essential to survival, but it now took on new urgency. Failure to sow at the proper time could result not only in the starvation of a family but of an entire city as populations began to rise. Just as importantly, farming required staying in one place for much or all of the year to watch over the crops, changing the concept of geography.</p>
